# pdb
change format from pdb to fasta .
python file change from https://gist.github.com/jameslyons/00cad4f1ab6a49c2b3df .(There is a mistake when i use it, so i change it)
And C++ file is written by myself.

For python file:
an example:
in bash
python pdb2fasta.py sa.pdb > sa.fa  
(if your original file is sa.pdb and your target file is sa.fa)


For c++ file:

if your original file to be in.pdb and your target file will be out.fa
